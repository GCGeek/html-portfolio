<p>Math always came easy to me, so I lived a nice, comfortable life as an IT nerd and media product manager. Then midlife struck and something didn't add up. Sure, numbers are cool, but creativity is unquantifiable. Instead of hitting the bars, I hit my keyboard: one page at a time.</p>

<p>I write TV scripts, pilots, screenplays, sketches, and jokes. When I'm not playing my guitar or building spreadsheets, I love to write jokes on Twitter where you can find me as <a href="https://twitter.com/GCGeek" target="_blank">@GCGeek</a>.</p>
  
<p>And because I never sleep, I build WordPress web sites for fellow creatives with my friend Chris Mueller, a fellow screenwriter, at <a href="https://smashcutdesigns.com/" target="_blank">SmashCut Designs</a>.</p>

<p>By night I'm a screenwriter, and by day I'm a Product Manager who loves to work with tech, business and customers.</p>
